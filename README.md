# Shamir's Secret Sharing - Catalog Placement Assignment

This repository contains the solution to the **Catalog Placement Assignment** implementing a simplified version of **Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing** algorithm using **C++**.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

You are given encoded `(x, y)` roots of a polynomial of degree `m`, and you must:

1. Decode the `y` values (provided in different bases)
2. Reconstruct the polynomial using **Lagrange interpolation**
3. Find the **secret**, i.e., the constant term `c` of the polynomial

## âœ… Features

- Reads test cases from separate JSON files
- Decodes base-N encoded values to decimal
- Uses Lagrange interpolation to solve the polynomial
- Outputs the **secret** from both test cases
